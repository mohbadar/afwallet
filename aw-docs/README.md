As the sustainability, reliability, interoperability, architectural design and security are becoming
essential for governmental software platforms, it is vital to build a framework (an integrated
collection of components that collaborate to produce a reusable architecture for a family of related
applications) to achieve the goals.


In recognition that there is a clear need for a standardized development framework for building
large code-bases and deploying projects to increase efficiency, enhance the interoperability of
systems, resolve dependency on outsider vendors and enhance the software quality, we need to
invest in building our own framework in order to achieve a higher level of efficiency in software
development. The framework will provide the foundation and tools for developing software
applications that allow software developers to focus on the business logic, rather than the technical
infrastructure of a program.

##### What the framework will be providing:

- Provides common essential functions and utility classes for building well-design softwares.
- Provides a per-configured, integrated, and comprehensive development environment.
- Provides general technical infrastructure of software applications, allowing developers to
focus on writing code for the business logic
- Simplifies software development process by providing standardized tools for developing
software and built-in decisions about fundamental architecture and design issues
- Improves productivity by increasing the reusability of common components of systems
developed through the standard framework, thereby avoiding redundant development of
same components
- Raises quality of software applications by providing technical code for generic services
needed by most applications, where developers are prone to making errors
- Standardizes the software development process for consistency and predictability
- Enhances interoperability of systems and information-sharing between related department
through standard inter-system integration interfaces.
- Provides standards for modular programming and thereby facilitates swift replacement of
modules for easy maintenance of software applications and adoption of fast changing
technologies
- Provides a reliable technology infrastructure based on carefully selected Open Source and
major software vendors’ frameworks
- Programming Language Independence
